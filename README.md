### Objective  
The objective of this project is to develop a graphical user interface (GUI)-based Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator using Python's Tkinter library. The application allows users to calculate their BMI and provides a health classification based on the calculated value.  

### Key Activities  
- **GUI Design**:  
  - Built an interactive interface using Tkinter widgets such as `Label`, `Entry`, and `Button`.  
  - Designed an intuitive layout for ease of use.  
- **BMI Calculation**:  
  - Implemented BMI calculation using the formula:  
    \[
    \text{BMI} = \frac{\text{Weight (kg)}}{\text{Height (m)}^2}
    \]  
  - Added error handling for invalid input.  
- **Classification Logic**:  
  - Provided health classifications based on BMI values:  
    - Underweight: BMI < 18.5  
    - Normal weight: 18.5 ≤ BMI < 24.9  
    - Overweight: 25 ≤ BMI < 29.9  
    - Obesity: BMI ≥ 30  

### Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Programming language for application development.  
- **Tkinter**: Built-in Python library for creating the GUI.  

### Features  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplified input fields for weight and height.  
- **Dynamic Results**: Displays calculated BMI and corresponding health classification.  
- **Error Handling**: Shows an error message if invalid inputs are entered.  

### Results  
- Successfully developed a functional and user-friendly BMI calculator.  
- Provided accurate BMI values and corresponding classifications based on user inputs.  

### Key Insights  
- **Interactive GUI**: Demonstrated how to create interactive desktop applications with Tkinter.  
- **Input Validation**: Showcased the importance of error handling for enhanced user experience.  
- **Health Awareness**: Helped users understand their BMI and its implications on health.  

This project highlights the integration of GUI design and functional programming to build a practical application for health awareness.
